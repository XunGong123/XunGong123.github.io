I am a junior student from [Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen](http://en.hitsz.edu.cn/) majoring in Automation. And I will obtain Bachelor's degree of Engineering in July 2025 as scheduled. 

In 2023 fall, I am now an exchange student at [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) in ECE.

I was advised by [Prof. Ying Zhang](http://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/zhangying) from School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, and investigated iterative algorithms of Lyapunov matrix equations in the summer of 2023.

I take interest in RF circuits & systems and deep learning, craving for opportunities in these fields.

My CV is here: [Xun Gong's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
