As a junior undergraduate from [Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen](http://en.hitsz.edu.cn/) majoring in Automation now, I will obtain the Bachelor's degree of Engineering in July 2025 as scheduled. On the other hand, my research interest lies in RF/Analog Circuits and Systems Design.

Now, I am doing research at [MUSIC Lab](https://music-sustech.github.io/) of Southern University of Science and Technology advised by [Prof. Xiaoguang (Leo)Liu](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=liuxg&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=1) engaging in RF circuits design.

In 2023 fall, I was a visiting student at [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) in ECE. I participated in a project investigating cultural differences of facial expressions with methods like CNN and Vision Transformer in [Prof. Xinyu Zhang](https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/people/profile/xinyu-zhang)'s Lab.

I was advised by [Prof. Ying Zhang](http://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/zhangying) from Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, and investigated iterative algorithms of Lyapunov matrix equations in the summer of 2023.

My CV is here: [Xun Gong's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
