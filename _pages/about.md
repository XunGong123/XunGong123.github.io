As a junior undergraduate from Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen majoring in Automation, I am going to obtain the degree of B.Eng in July 2025. My research interest lies in RF/Analog Circuits and Systems Design.

Now, I am engaging in RF circuits design in [MUSIC Lab](https://music-sustech.github.io/) of SUSTech advised by [Prof. Xiaoguang (Leo)Liu](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=liuxg&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=1).

In 2023 fall, as a visiting student at University of California, San Diego in Electrical and Computer Engineering, I participated in a project studying cultural differences in facial expressions with deep learning methods supervised by [Prof. Xinyu Zhang](https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/people/profile/xinyu-zhang).

From July to August in 2023, I was advised by [Prof. Ying Zhang](http://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/zhangying) from Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen investigating iterative algorithms of Lyapunov matrix equations .

My CV is here: [Xun Gong's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
